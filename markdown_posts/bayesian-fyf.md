# The Budget That Learns

**Bayesian Forecasting for Periodic Budget Revisions — from Prior Beliefs to Posterior Certainty**

## 1. Introduction: The Forecast That Learns

Every budget analyst lives the same calendar. December: a plan is
approved. April, July, October, January-of-next-year: a Forecast
Year-end Financial (FYF) review revises the plan against year-to-date
actuals. The revisions are quarterly; the questions are perennial.
*By how much should I move the forecast? How tight is my new estimate?
What is the chance of breaching the budget ceiling by year-end?*

The traditional answer treats each revision as a fresh estimate. The
analyst stares at year-to-date actuals, mentally weighs them against
the plan, and produces a new number. The new number is then defended
in a meeting; the defence is usually qualitative; the weight chosen
is rarely auditable.

This article argues that the FYF cycle is, in a precise mathematical
sense, **sequential Bayesian updating**. The plan is a *prior*. The
actuals are *data*. The revised forecast is a *posterior*. This is
not analogy; it is identity. And recognising the identity turns three
qualitative pain-points into closed-form results:

1. *How do I weight the plan against the data?* — The
 **precision-weighted mean** of the Normal–Normal posterior. The
 weights are not a matter of judgement: they are functions of the
 stated prior uncertainty and the per-month observation noise.
2. *How tight is my forecast?* — The posterior variance shrinks
 monotonically with each new month. Phase 3 will make this
 "monotonically" both rigorous and quantitative.
3. *What is the probability of ending the year over budget?* — The
 posterior **predictive** distribution applied to the unobserved
 months gives an exact closed form, not a heuristic.

The route from claim to proof is short. Section 2 derives Bayes'
theorem for continuous parameters and clarifies the difference
between credible intervals and confidence intervals. Section 3
develops the four conjugate prior–likelihood pairs that cover the
FYF cost model. Section 4 chains conjugate updates across the year
and proves that sequential and batch updating produce identical
posteriors. Section 5 layers the posterior predictive on top — what
the CFO actually wants. Section 6 wires the machinery into a complete
annual cycle of a 50-person IT-headcount budget. Section 7 runs the
experiments. Section 8 supplies the diagnostics that decide when the
model is to be trusted and when its mechanical answer is misleading.
Sections 9–11 connect to the series and close.

### Scope and anti-scope

The article covers Bayes' theorem for continuous parameters; the
four conjugate pairs (Normal–Normal, Normal–Inverse-Gamma,
Gamma–Poisson, Beta–Binomial); sequential updating and shrinkage
asymptotics; posterior predictive distributions and the year-end
total; prior sensitivity; model checking via posterior predictive
checks. It deliberately does **not** cover MCMC, hierarchical models,
nonparametric Bayes, variational inference, or real company data.
The article's contribution is that **closed-form Bayesian updating
is enough** to explain and improve the FYF cycle.

### What the reader will need

A solid undergraduate background: integration by substitution,
completing the square, the Normal/LogNormal/Poisson distributions,
the law of total variance. Bayes' theorem in its discrete form.
Every continuous result is derived from these in full.

## 2. Bayes' Theorem for Budget Analysts

Let $X$ denote observed data and $\theta$ an unknown parameter,
both treated as random variables. The **product rule for densities**
factorises the joint two ways:

$$
f(x, \theta) = f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta) = \pi(\theta \mid x) f(x).
$$

Equating and solving for the second factor gives **Bayes' theorem
for continuous parameters**:

$$
\boxed{\quad
\pi(\theta \mid x) = \frac{f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)}{f(x)},
\qquad
f(x) = \int f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta) \mathrm d\theta.
\quad}
$$

The four objects have names. $\pi(\theta)$ is the **prior**; in FYF,
the budget plan expressed as a distribution. $f(x \mid \theta)$ is
the **sampling density**, viewed as a function of $\theta$ for fixed
$x$ it is the **likelihood**. $f(x)$ is the **marginal likelihood**
or evidence — the probability of the data averaged over the prior.
$\pi(\theta \mid x)$ is the **posterior**: the revised forecast.

Because $f(x)$ does not involve $\theta$, the proportional form
$\pi(\theta \mid x) \propto f(x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta)$ is
operationally enough. In conjugate families (§3) we recognise the
kernel of the right-hand side as that of a known distribution and
read off the hyperparameters; the marginal likelihood is implied by
the family and never has to be integrated.

### Point summaries

When a number is required:

- **Maximum a posteriori (MAP)**: $\hat\theta_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\max_\theta \pi(\theta \mid x)$.
- **Posterior mean**: $\hat\theta_{\text{PM}} = \mathbb E[\theta \mid x]$.
- **Posterior median**.

For symmetric unimodal posteriors (every Normal posterior in this
article) the three coincide. For a uniform prior the MAP equals the
maximum-likelihood estimator: a flat prior produces the classical
point estimate, but with a credible-interval interpretation that
remains different from a confidence interval — see below.

### Credible intervals vs confidence intervals

A **$100(1-\alpha)\%$ credible interval** for $\theta$ is any subset
$C$ with $\Pr(\theta \in C \mid x) = 1 - \alpha$. The most-used choice
is the equal-tailed interval bounded by the $\alpha/2$ and
$1 - \alpha/2$ posterior quantiles.

The contrast with the frequentist confidence interval is the
conceptual hinge of the article. The credible interval makes a
direct probability statement *about $\theta$* given the realised
data: "given what I saw, there is a 95 % chance the parameter lies
in $[a, b]$". The frequentist interval makes a statement *about the
procedure*: 95 % of the intervals constructed by this rule, across
hypothetical repetitions of the experiment, would contain the true
$\theta$. After observing one specific dataset, the frequentist
interval either contains $\theta$ or it does not — there is no
probability statement about *that* interval. Both intervals can
numerically agree in simple cases, but their interpretations differ.

For a budget committee asking "will we exceed R\$ 13.2 M?" the
relevant statement is about the parameter (or the forecast), not
about the procedure. The credible interval is the operational
object.

### Prior elicitation: the budget plan IS a prior

The classic objection — "but the prior is subjective" — misses the
point. The budget plan was always subjective. The Bayesian framework
makes the subjectivity explicit and updateable. A planner who states
"we expect monthly cost $\mu_0$ with $\gamma$-confidence that the
truth is within $\pm w$" is implicitly specifying a Normal prior
$N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$ with

$$
\sigma_0 = \frac{w}{z_{(1+\gamma)/2}},
$$

where $z_q$ is the standard-Normal quantile. The article's reference
scenario uses $\mu_0$ = R\$ 1,050,000,
$\sigma_0$ = R\$ 150,000 — a budget plan and a stated
uncertainty, translated into a prior in one line.

---

## 3. Conjugate Families: Closed-Form Updating

A family $\mathcal F$ of priors is **conjugate** to a sampling model
if the posterior obtained by Bayes' theorem stays in $\mathcal F$.
Hyperparameters update by an explicit rule; the marginal likelihood
is implied; sequential updating becomes addition (§4). The four
pairs in this section cover every component of the FYF cost model.

![Experiment B — four conjugate pairs side by side. Each panel: prior in steelblue, posterior in crimson after a small batch of synthetic data.](../figures/bayesian-fyf/exp_b_conjugate_families.png)

### 3.1 Normal–Normal (known variance) — the article's anchor

Let $\theta$ be the unknown mean of a Normal sampling model with
**known** variance $\sigma^2$:

$$
x_1, \ldots, x_n \mid \theta \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} N(\theta, \sigma^2),
\qquad
\theta \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2).
$$

The likelihood, viewed as a function of $\theta$ and after expanding
$\sum (x_i - \theta)^2 = \sum (x_i - \bar x)^2 + n(\bar x - \theta)^2$,
is proportional to $\exp\big(-\tfrac{n}{2\sigma^2}(\theta - \bar x)^2\big)$.
Multiplying by the prior, grouping powers of $\theta$, and completing
the square yields a Normal kernel with

$$
\boxed{\quad
\theta \mid x_{1:n} \sim N(\mu_n, \sigma_n^2),
\qquad
\tau_n = \tau_0 + n\tau,
\qquad
\mu_n = \frac{\tau_0\mu_0 + n\tau\bar x}{\tau_n},
\quad}
$$

where $\tau \equiv 1/\sigma^2$ and $\tau_0 \equiv 1/\sigma_0^2$ are
the **precisions** (inverse variances). Equivalently, in variance
form,

$$
\mu_n = \frac{\sigma^2 \mu_0 + n \sigma_0^2 \bar x}{\sigma^2 + n \sigma_0^2},
\qquad
\sigma_n^2 = \frac{\sigma^2 \sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2 + n \sigma_0^2}.
$$

This identity admits three equivalent readings.

**Precision additivity.** $\tau_n = \tau_0 + n\tau$. Each new
observation adds exactly $\tau$ units of precision, regardless of
its value.

**Weighted average of means.** With $w_0 \equiv \tau_0 / (\tau_0 + n\tau)$
and $w_d \equiv 1 - w_0$, $\mu_n = w_0\mu_0 + w_d \bar x$. The
weights are proportional to the *information content* of each
source — prior information $\tau_0$, data information $n\tau$.

**Shrinkage to the prior.** Equivalently, $\mu_n = \bar x + w_0(\mu_0 - \bar x)$:
the data mean is shrunk toward the prior mean by a factor $w_0$.

### 3.2 Normal–Inverse-Gamma (unknown variance)

When $\sigma^2$ is also unknown, the conjugate prior is the
**Normal–Inverse-Gamma**:
$\sigma^2 \sim \text{Inverse-Gamma}(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$,
$\theta \mid \sigma^2 \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma^2/\kappa_0)$. The same
"completing the square" argument gives the four updates

$$
\mu_n = \frac{\kappa_0 \mu_0 + n\bar x}{\kappa_0 + n},
\quad
\kappa_n = \kappa_0 + n,
\quad
\alpha_n = \alpha_0 + \frac{n}{2},
$$

$$
\beta_n = \beta_0 + \tfrac{1}{2} S + \tfrac{1}{2} \frac{\kappa_0 n}{\kappa_0 + n} (\bar x - \mu_0)^2,
\quad S = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2.
$$

The marginal posterior of $\theta$ is a Student-$t$ with $2\alpha_n$
degrees of freedom; the marginal of $\sigma^2$ is
Inverse-Gamma$(\alpha_n, \beta_n)$. As $n \to \infty$ the posterior
concentrates on $(\bar x, S/n) \to (\theta_\star, \sigma_\star^2)$.

### 3.3 Gamma–Poisson — updating event rates

For monthly incident counts modelled as
$x_i \mid \lambda \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ with prior
$\lambda \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$ (rate
parameterisation), the posterior is

$$
\boxed{\quad
\lambda \mid x_{1:n} \sim \text{Gamma}\Big(\alpha_0 + \textstyle\sum_i x_i, \beta_0 + n\Big).
\quad}
$$

The interpretation is **pseudo-observations**: $\alpha_0$ acts as
"prior event count", $\beta_0$ as "prior pseudo-observation period".
Real events and real periods simply add.

### 3.4 Beta–Binomial — updating proportions

For an overtime proportion $p$ with prior $\text{Beta}(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$
and observation $x \mid p \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)$,

$$
\boxed{\quad
p \mid x \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_0 + x, \beta_0 + n - x).
\quad}
$$

The pattern repeats: $\alpha_0$ are prior successes, $\beta_0$ prior
failures, real data adds.

### 3.5 The pattern

All four pairs share the same shape: the prior contributes a finite
"imaginary" sample, the data contributes a real sample, and the
totals add. This is the intuitive content of conjugacy — and the
algebraic foundation for everything that follows.

---

## 4. Sequential Updating and Shrinkage

### 4.1 Sequential = batch

The FYF cycle feeds data **one month at a time**. Does the result
agree with what the analyst would obtain by waiting until December
and computing one batch posterior?

**Theorem (sequential = batch).** Under conditional independence,
applying the conjugate update once per observation (using the
previous posterior as the next prior) produces the **same**
hyperparameters as applying the batch update directly to all data.

For Normal–Normal the proof is direct: $\tau_n = \tau_0 + n\tau$ is
linear in $n$ and accumulates the same $\tau$ regardless of the
order of operations; the mean update $\mu_n = (\tau_0\mu_0 + n\tau\bar x)/\tau_n$
is the same telescoping sum either way. For general exponential
families the conjugate hyperparameter map is *additive* in $n$ and
in the sufficient statistic $\sum_i T(x_i)$, so the cumulative
increments after $n$ sequential steps equal the batch increments.

The theorem says the FYF cycle is **not** a heuristic. An analyst
who saves the previous posterior and applies the conjugate rule
month by month will, by year-end, hold exactly the posterior they
would have obtained had they waited and done one big update.

### 4.2 The shrinkage formula and three consequences

The Normal–Normal posterior mean is the convex combination

$$
\mu_n = w_0(n) \mu_0 + (1 - w_0(n)) \bar x_n,
\qquad
w_0(n) = \frac{\tau_0}{\tau_0 + n\tau} = \frac{\sigma^2/\sigma_0^2}{\sigma^2/\sigma_0^2 + n}.
$$

Three consequences follow immediately:

- **Shrinkage weight decays as $1/n$**. $w_0(n) = \Theta(1/n)$, with
 leading constant $\sigma^2/\sigma_0^2$.
- **Posterior variance decays as $1/n$**. $\sigma_n^2 = 1/(\tau_0 + n\tau) \sim \sigma^2/n$,
 matching the frequentist sampling variance of $\bar X_n$
 asymptotically.
- **Posterior mean converges to the data mean**.
 $\mu_n - \bar x_n = w_0(n)(\mu_0 - \bar x_n) \to 0$.

The recursive **Kalman-gain** form

$$
\mu_n = \mu_{n-1} + K_n(x_n - \mu_{n-1}),
\qquad
K_n = \frac{\sigma_{n-1}^2}{\sigma_{n-1}^2 + \sigma^2}
$$

makes the update look like signal processing: the "innovation"
$x_n - \mu_{n-1}$ is the surprise, and $K_n$ scales how much of it
the posterior absorbs. This is the discrete Kalman filter for a
static parameter.

![Experiment C — sequential shrinkage. Left: posterior trajectory and 95 % credible band over 12 months. Right: the closed-form prior weight $w_0(n)$ decaying toward zero, with markers at the 80 % and 95 % data-weight thresholds.](../figures/bayesian-fyf/exp_c_sequential_shrinkage.png)

### 4.3 FYF reading: when does the data dominate?

With reference parameters $\sigma_0 = 150{,}000$, $\sigma = 80{,}000$,
the ratio $\sigma^2/\sigma_0^2 \approx 0.2844$:

| Month $n$ | $w_0(n)$ | $1 - w_0(n)$ |
|----------:|---------:|-------------:|
| 1 | 0.2215 | 0.7785 |
| 3 | 0.0866 | 0.9134 |
| 6 | 0.0453 | 0.9547 |
| 12 | 0.0232 | 0.9768 |

The data's share crosses **80 % at $n = 2$** (already by February
with monthly revisions), **95 % at $n = 6$** (mid-year FYF). By the
year-end posterior, the budget plan accounts for ≈ 2.3 % of the
answer.

### 4.4 Prior sensitivity

Two analysts with the same $\sigma_0$ but different prior means
$\mu_0^{(A)} \ne \mu_0^{(B)}$ produce posteriors whose disagreement
shrinks at exactly $w_0(n)$:

$$
\big|\mu_n^{(A)} - \mu_n^{(B)}\big| = w_0(n) \cdot \big|\mu_0^{(A)} - \mu_0^{(B)}\big|.
$$

By month 6, an initial gap of R\$ 150{,}000 has shrunk to ≈ R\$ 6{,}780.
By year-end, to ≈ R\$ 3{,}460. The data forces consensus.

![Experiment D — three priors converging under the same data. The right panel plots the gap on a log scale against the closed-form prediction $w_0(n) \cdot \Delta\mu_0$.](../figures/bayesian-fyf/exp_d_prior_sensitivity.png)

### 4.5 Prior–data conflict

Define the discrepancy $D_n = |\mu_0 - \bar x_n|/\sigma_0$. When
$D_n \gg 3$ — the data is "far from" the prior, in prior units —
the conjugate update still produces a number, but that number is
mechanical rather than meaningful. The model has assumed the prior
is correctly elicited and the sampling model is well specified; if
either fails the posterior interpolates between two wrong sources.

Operationally: at any FYF, if $D_n > 3$, *stop and diagnose*. Either
re-elicit the prior, or change the sampling model (often: the world
changed — re-org, vendor switch, structural shock). The Bayesian
machine answers; the analyst owns the interpretation.

---

## 5. Posterior Predictive: Forecasting, Not Estimating

The posterior $\pi(\theta \mid x)$ is a means; the posterior
**predictive** $p(\tilde x \mid x)$ is the end. The predictive is
what the business wants: not "what is the mean cost?" but "what
will next month cost? what will the year-end total cost?".

### 5.1 Definition and decomposition

$$
\boxed{\quad
p(\tilde x \mid x) = \int f(\tilde x \mid \theta) \pi(\theta \mid x) \mathrm d\theta.
\quad}
$$

The predictive variance decomposes via the **law of total variance**:

$$
\mathrm{Var}(\tilde x \mid x)
 = 
\underbrace{\mathbb E\big[\mathrm{Var}(\tilde x \mid \theta) \mid x\big]}_{\text{expected sampling noise}}
 + 
\underbrace{\mathrm{Var}\big(\mathbb E[\tilde x \mid \theta] \mid x\big)}_{\text{parameter uncertainty}}.
$$

The first term is **irreducible noise**. The second term shrinks
with more data. A predictive interval is therefore always **wider**
than the credible interval for $\theta$, and the gap closes
asymptotically toward $\pm 1.96\sigma$ — never toward zero. This is
the formal reason credible intervals on the parameter alone
under-state the uncertainty about future observations.

![Experiment A — single Normal-Normal update with the precision-weighted-mean decomposition. The credible interval for $\theta$ (steelblue band) is narrower than the predictive interval for the next observation (crimson band).](../figures/bayesian-fyf/exp_a_prior_to_posterior.png)

### 5.2 Closed forms

For the three pairs the article uses operationally:

- **Normal–Normal**: $\tilde x \mid x \sim N(\mu_n, \sigma_n^2 + \sigma^2)$.
- **Gamma–Poisson**: $\tilde x \mid x \sim \text{NegBin}(\alpha_n, \beta_n/(\beta_n+1))$,
 shape–success parameterisation. Predictive mean $\alpha_n/\beta_n$,
 variance $\alpha_n(\beta_n+1)/\beta_n^2 > \alpha_n/\beta_n$ —
 **overdispersion** induced by parameter uncertainty.
- **Beta–Binomial**: future batch of size $m$ has predictive PMF
 $\Pr(\tilde x = k) = \binom{m}{k} B(\alpha_n + k, \beta_n + m - k)/B(\alpha_n, \beta_n)$.

### 5.3 The year-end total — beware of independence

After observing $m$ months with cumulative $S_m$, the remaining
total $\tilde S = \sum_{t=m+1}^{12} \tilde x_t$ is **not** the sum
of iid predictives. The future months share the unknown $\theta$
and are therefore correlated under the posterior.

Writing $\tilde x_t = \theta + \varepsilon_t$ with $\varepsilon_t$
iid $N(0, \sigma^2)$ independent of $\theta$, the sum is
$(12 - m)\theta + \sum \varepsilon_t$. The two summands are
independent given $x_{1:m}$; their variances add:

$$
\boxed{\quad
\tilde S \mid x_{1:m} \sim N\big((12-m) \mu_m, (12-m)^2 \sigma_m^2 + (12-m) \sigma^2\big).
\quad}
$$

The parameter-uncertainty term is **quadratic** in the horizon
$(12-m)$, not linear. The naïve "iid future months" formula
$(12-m)(\sigma_m^2 + \sigma^2)$ under-estimates the variance by a
factor of $(12-m)$ in the parameter share. In early months the
horizon is long and the naïve under-estimate is large.

The annual total is $T = S_m + \tilde S$, a Normal with mean
$S_m + (12-m)\mu_m$ and the variance above. Then

$$
P(T > B \mid x_{1:m})
 = 
1 - \Phi\Big(\frac{B - (S_m + (12-m)\mu_m)}{\sqrt{(12-m)^2 \sigma_m^2 + (12-m)\sigma^2}}\Big).
$$

For the reference scenario at mid-year with
$\mu_6$ = R\$ 1,085,000,
$\sigma_6$ = R\$ 32,000,
$S_6$ = R\$ 6,510,000, $B$ = R\$ 13,200,000:
$P(T > B) \approx 26\%$ under the correct formula, vs ≈ 20 % under
the naïve iid calculation. **The dependence between future months
is not a rounding error.**

### 5.4 Connection to Article 1 — Monte Carlo posterior predictive

The closed forms are convenient, but the Monte Carlo recipe works
in any setting:

1. Draw $\theta^{(s)} \sim \pi(\theta \mid x)$.
2. Draw $\tilde x^{(s)} \sim f( \cdot \mid \theta^{(s)})$.

This is exactly the Article-1 strategy applied to the posterior.
Crucially, for multi-period sums **reuse the same $\theta^{(s)}$
across all future months in a replication** — that is what
preserves the correlation that produces the quadratic variance term.

### 5.5 Bayes factors (brief)

For two competing models $M_1, M_2$ the **Bayes factor** is
$BF_{12} = p(x \mid M_1)/p(x \mid M_2)$, the ratio of marginal
likelihoods. Combined with prior model probabilities it yields
posterior model odds. Under Jeffreys' scale,
$\log_{10} BF \in [1, 1.5]$ is "strong", $> 2$ is "decisive". In
large samples $\log BF \approx -\tfrac{1}{2}(\Delta\text{BIC})$,
linking the Bayes factor to BIC and (approximately) AIC. We use the
Bayes factor as a conceptually cleaner comparator to Article 2's
AIC/BIC; we do not use it as the article's primary inference tool.

## 6. The FYF Model: A Complete Annual Cycle

### 6.1 The cost decomposition

Monthly cost decomposes into three components — salary plus
benefits, overtime, and incidents:

$$
X_t = \underbrace{n_t \cdot \bar S_t \cdot \beta}_{\text{salary + benefits}}
 + \underbrace{C_{\text{ot},t}}_{\text{overtime}}
 + \underbrace{C_{\text{inc},t}}_{\text{incidents}}.
$$

For the article's central inference layer, $\theta$ is the **mean
monthly cost** with $X_t \mid \theta \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2)$ and
$\sigma$ known. The Gamma–Poisson incident-count and Beta–Binomial
overtime-proportion priors developed in §3 cover the other two
components and slot into the same machine; we keep the canonical
scenarios in this section single-component to isolate the Bayesian
mechanics.

### 6.2 The revision calendar

| Month | Event | Bayesian analogue |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| December (year N−1) | Budget plan approved | Prior $\pi(\theta)$ |
| Jan–Mar | Q1 actuals arrive | Likelihood $L(\theta\mid x_{1:3})$ |
| **April** | **FYF #1 (Q1 review)** | Posterior #1 |
| Apr–Jun | Q2 actuals arrive | New likelihood |
| **July** | **FYF #2 (mid-year)** | Posterior #2 |
| Jul–Sep | Q3 actuals arrive | New likelihood |
| **October** | **FYF #3 (Q3 review)** | Posterior #3 |
| Oct–Dec | Q4 actuals arrive | Final data |
| Jan (year N+1) | Year-end close | Posterior #4 |

Each FYF is a posterior. The previous posterior becomes the next
prior. By the sequential = batch theorem (§4), the year-end
posterior equals the single batch posterior conditioned on all 12
actuals.

### 6.3 Reference parameters

A 50-person IT team, average gross monthly salary R\$ 12{,}000,
benefit-and-charge multiplier 1.75:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Prior mean $\mu_0$ | R\$ 1{,}050{,}000 | $50 \times 12{,}000 \times 1.75$. |
| Prior s.d. $\sigma_0$ | R\$ 150{,}000 | Planner is ≈ 90 % sure within ±15 %. |
| Observation s.d. $\sigma$ | R\$ 80{,}000 | Observed month-to-month variability. |
| Budget ceiling $B$ | R\$ 13{,}200{,}000 | A typical guard-rail at $\mu_0 \times 12 \times 1.05$. |
| Incident-rate prior | $\text{Gamma}(3, 1)$ | Prior expectation 3 incidents/month. |
| Overtime-proportion prior | $\text{Beta}(2, 8)$ | Prior expectation 20 %. |

### 6.4 The FYF model object

Operationally we package the engine as a stateful object that, for
each incoming month, (i) computes the surprise z-score before
consuming the actual, (ii) feeds the actual through the conjugate
updater, (iii) refreshes the year-end forecast and $P(T > B)$. At
the close of each quarter the same object emits a `QuarterlyReview`
record with the posterior, the year-end forecast, the maximum
absolute surprise in the quarter, and a one-line recommendation
("hold", "re-elicit", "investigate shock", "request budget
revision").

### 6.5 The annual cycle, end to end

Figure 6 shows a full simulation of the **on-target scenario**:
12 monthly actuals drawn from $N(\theta_\star = 1{,}080{,}000, \sigma)$
(so the true mean is slightly above the planner's expectation).
The top panel walks the posterior: a steep correction in Q1, then
month-by-month tightening. The bottom panel walks the year-end
forecast: the predictive interval narrows from
$\pm \approx$ R\$ 950,000 at month 1 to $\pm \approx$ R\$ 50,000
at month 11.

![Experiment E — full annual FYF cycle. Top: posterior trajectory with a 95 % credible band, monthly actuals as grey dots, and quarterly FYF review boxes. Bottom: year-end total predictive vs the budget ceiling.](../figures/bayesian-fyf/exp_e_fyf_quarterly.png)

### 6.6 Key questions the model answers

Five practical questions, each mapping cleanly onto a Bayesian
quantity:

1. **Shrinkage**: how much does each month pull the forecast away
 from the plan? — The trajectory $\mu_n$.
2. **Precision**: how tight is the 95 % credible interval at each
 FYF? — $\pm 1.96\sigma_n$.
3. **Surprise detection**: when should we override the update? —
 The surprise z-score (§8).
4. **Prior sensitivity**: how much does the prior choice matter
 after 6 months? — The shrinkage of the prior gap by $w_0(n)$.
5. **Predictive accuracy**: what is $P(T > B)$? — The closed form
 in §5.3.

## 7. Experiments and Results

We run eight experiments end-to-end and one animated companion. Each
script is in `scripts/`; each figure is at 300 DPI with a fixed
seed.

| ID | Topic | Headline |
|----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| A | Prior to posterior | A single update visualised end to end. |
| B | Four conjugate families | One update rule, four distributional families (figure in §3). |
| C | Sequential shrinkage | Posterior tightens monotonically; $w_0(n) \to 0$ at rate $1/n$. |
| D | Prior sensitivity | Three priors converge by Q3; gap decays at $w_0(n)$. |
| E | Full FYF quarterly cycle | Annual cycle with quarterly review boxes (figure in §6). |
| F | Bayesian vs frequentist | 100 frequentist CIs (~5 % miss) vs a single credible interval. |
| G | Bayes factor vs AIC | Both converge; Bayes factor sits on the Jeffreys scale. |
| H | Posterior predictive check | Calibration plot, z-score histogram, p-value CDF (§8). |

Three experiments deserve a paragraph here.

**F — Bayesian vs frequentist.** Experiment F draws 100 simulated
samples of size $n = 30$ from $N(\theta_\star, \sigma^2)$. For each
sample we compute the frequentist 95 % CI; the empirical coverage
sits within Monte Carlo error of the nominal 95 %. Approximately
five intervals miss the truth — the procedure-level guarantee. The
bottom panel takes one of the samples and plots the corresponding
Bayesian credible interval. The numerical values nearly coincide
with the frequentist interval (which is the point Phase 2 §2.7
makes formally — the improper-prior Bayesian recovers the
frequentist sampling distribution), but the *statements* differ:
the credible interval is a probability claim about $\theta$ given
this dataset, the confidence interval a frequency claim about the
procedure across replications. For a budget committee asking about
*this year*, the Bayesian statement is the operational one.

**G — Bayes factors and AIC.** Experiment G simulates data from a
prior centred at the truth and compares it against an alternative
prior that is 5 prior standard deviations off. The log marginal
likelihood under each prior is computed in closed form (Phase 4 §7);
the Bayes factor in favour of the right prior crosses the
"decisive" threshold on Jeffreys' scale by about $n = 6$ and grows
exponentially thereafter. AIC, under the same identification, agrees
on direction.

**H — posterior predictive check.** Experiment H runs 250 simulated
annual cycles. For each, a true $\theta$ is drawn from the prior;
12 actuals are drawn from $N(\theta, \sigma^2)$; the model is fed
those actuals and produces predictive intervals. Aggregating across
replications, we recover (i) a calibration plot that lies on the
diagonal (empirical coverage matches nominal), (ii) a histogram of
surprise z-scores that is approximately $N(0, 1)$, and (iii) a CDF
of two-sided predictive p-values that is approximately Uniform.
These three checks are the model's self-test: deviations indicate
mis-specification, not random Monte Carlo wiggle.

## 8. Diagnostics: Is the Model Working?

A Bayesian model is only as good as its assumptions. The diagnostic
layer answers a single question: when should we stop trusting the
output?

### 8.1 The surprise z-score

The standardised innovation under the posterior predictive is

$$
z_t = \frac{x_t - \mu_{t-1}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{t-1}^2 + \sigma^2}}.
$$

Under correct specification $z_t \mid x_{1:t-1} \sim N(0, 1)$. The
heuristic thresholds: $|z_t| > 2$ is "uncomfortable", $|z_t| > 3$
is "investigate". The $z$ scores are not iid in finite samples —
the previous posterior is itself random — but they are exchangeable
under correct specification, which is enough for routine practice.

### 8.2 Calibration

A 95 % equal-tailed predictive interval should contain the next
actual approximately 95 % of the time. Aggregating across $T$
months and $K$ years, the **calibration score** is the fraction of
actuals inside the interval. A binomial test checks whether the
score deviates significantly from the nominal level.

Under-coverage at the steady-state, large-$n$ regime indicates the
sampling-noise term $\sigma$ is too small. Over-coverage indicates
$\sigma$ is too large. Persistent miscalibration that *changes with
$n$* points instead at the prior — too tight or too loose.

### 8.3 Cumulative surprise

$S_n = \sum_{t \le n} z_t$ is, under correct specification, a
random walk with mean zero and variance growing linearly in $n$.
A sustained drift of $S_n / \sqrt n$ outside $[-2, 2]$ flags
**structural drift** — the sampling model has gone stale.

### 8.4 When the diagnostic fires

The article's operational rule:

| Diagnostic | Action |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Single $\lvert z_t\rvert > 3$ | One-off shock; trust the update; flag. |
| Repeated $\lvert z_t\rvert > 2$ same sign | Drift; re-elicit prior or change model. |
| Calibration $\widehat C \le 0.85$ | Underconfident model; $\sigma$ too small. |
| Calibration $\widehat C \ge 0.99$ | Over-cautious; $\sigma$ too large; vague. |

The diagnostic does not replace judgement. It tells the analyst
when to stop trusting the conjugate update and start asking why.

## 9. Connection to the Series

This is article 4 of a four-part series on probabilistic methods
for budget analytics. Each prior article supplies a building block
that this article uses or extends.

- **Article 1 — Monte Carlo budget.** The Article-1 simulation
 strategy reappears in §5.4 as posterior predictive sampling. The
 only change is the *input* distribution: Article 1 sampled from
 the prior; this article samples from the posterior, which is
 the prior updated with observed months. Same machine, better
 input.
- **Article 2 — Distributions.** The four conjugate prior
 distributions in §3 — Normal, Inverse-Gamma, Gamma, Beta — are
 exactly the families fitted in Article 2. The likelihood
 building blocks (Normal, Poisson, Binomial) are also from
 Article 2. This article uses Article 2's MLE / AIC / BIC machinery
 as a comparator in §5.5 and Experiment G.
- **Article 3 — Headcount Markov chains.** Article 3 modelled the
 evolution of $n_t$ — team size — via a birth-death chain. Plugged
 into the §6.1 cost decomposition $X_t = n_t \bar S_t \beta + \cdots$,
 it allows $n_t$ to drift over the year. The Article-3 transition
 rates feed the headcount portion; the Bayesian inference layer in
 this article infers the *cost-per-head times benefit multiplier*
 given $n_t$.

Together the four articles cover a single problem from four sides:
how to *simulate* it (Article 1), how to *fit* its components
(Article 2), how its *components evolve* (Article 3), how to *learn
from incoming data* (this article).

## 10. A Practical Framework for Budget Analysts

A short checklist, derived from the article's central results.

1. **Translate the plan into a prior.** Plan value is $\mu_0$;
 stated confidence and band width fix $\sigma_0 = w/z_{(1+\gamma)/2}$.
 Document both. Re-elicit at the start of each fiscal year.
2. **Score every FYF on shrinkage and precision.** Report
 $\mu_n$, $\sigma_n$, the 95 % credible interval, and the prior
 weight $w_0(n)$. The prior weight tells the audience how much
 the new forecast still leans on the original plan; it should
 trend toward zero.
3. **Report the predictive, not the posterior, for forward-looking
 questions.** Internal "what is our best estimate of the mean?"
 uses the credible interval. External "will we exceed the
 budget?" uses the predictive: $P(T > B)$ via the year-end
 formula in §5.3, with the **correct** quadratic-horizon variance.
4. **Run the diagnostic at every quarterly review.** Compute the
 surprise z-scores for the months of the quarter, the calibration
 score on the year-to-date, and the cumulative surprise.
 Investigate any single $|z| > 3$, any pattern of $|z| > 2$, or
 persistent miscalibration.
5. **Treat prior–data conflict as a signal, not a number.** When
 $D_n = |\mu_0 - \bar x_n|/\sigma_0 > 3$, stop and ask why. The
 model assumed both the prior and the sampling model were well
 specified; if either fails, the posterior interpolates between
 two wrong sources. The right action is rarely to trust the
 posterior — usually it is to step outside the model and
 diagnose.

The framework is short by design. Bayesian inference does the math;
the analyst does the judgement.

## 11. Conclusion

A budget forecast that ignores its own history is a memoryless
estimator. Bayesian updating is the corrective: it combines the
budget plan (prior) with the observed actuals (likelihood) into a
revised forecast (posterior) that is mathematically optimal under
squared-error loss, monotonically tightens with each new month of
data, and reports its own uncertainty with auditable closed-form
intervals.

Three operational gains follow:

- The **precision-weighted mean** replaces ad-hoc reweighting of
 plan vs actuals. The weights are functions of stated
 uncertainties, not gut feeling.
- **Monotonic shrinkage** replaces vague claims that "the forecast
 got tighter": $\sigma_n$ decays at exactly $1/\sqrt n$, with a
 closed form for the data-share threshold.
- The **posterior predictive** answers $P(\text{annual total} > B)$
 directly, accounting for both parameter uncertainty and future
 noise — and including the often-missed dependence between
 unobserved months that share $\theta$.

The natural next article extends this framework to **hierarchical
models**: pooling information across cost centres, business units,
or teams. The conjugate machinery generalises directly; the
hierarchical step couples multiple FYF cycles through a shared
prior on the cross-team variation. That generalisation is for
another article.

For now: every FYF is a Bayesian update. The framework above turns
that observation into a tool.
